					<strong>So what is Question Bridge: Black Males?</strong><br/>
					 Question Bridge: Black Males is a platform for Black men of all ages and backgrounds to ask and respond to questions about life in America. We created it to stimulate connections and understanding among Black men, but we also wanted to show the diversity of thought, character and identity in the Black male population so rarely seen in American media. In essence, we want to represent and redefine Black male identity in America. In 2012, the project launched as a documentary-styled video art installation, but since then, it has expanded to include an interactive website and mobile app, community engagement events and an education curriculum for high school students.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Why do you feel the need to redefine black male identity?</strong><br/>
					Because we want to break down the negative perceptions people have about Black males. American media rarely shows whole, complex and authentic images of black men, so by creating a space where these images can live, we hope that people will start to see things differently.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>So what exactly is a "Question Bridge?"</strong><br/>
					It’s a method used by those who want to create honest expression and healing dialogue among members of a particular group. It works like this: first, one person asks a question looking into camera, as if they are talking directly to another person. Later, another person responds by talking directly into a camera. This question-answer exchange, the Question Bridge, reduces the stress of normal face-to-face conversations and makes people feel more comfortable with expressing their deeply held feelings on topics that divide, unite and puzzle. This was the central approach used in the project.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>How did the whole project begin?</strong><br/>
					In 1996, artist Chris Johnson, was looking for a way to start a conversation around class and generational divisions in San Diego’s African American community. Using a video camera and some question and answer exchanges, he was able to get ten members of the community to express their strongly held beliefs and values. A decade later, artist Hank Willis Thomas approached Johnson about doing a similar project focused on Black males. 
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>And it was launched as a documentary-styled art installation?</strong><br/>
					Yep- it premiered at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival New Frontier. But first, the team had to do some prep work, so Chris and Hank collaborated with artists Kamal Sinclair and Bayeté Ross Smith to record more than 1,600 question and answer videos from over 160 men in 9 cities in America. From there, they shaped the content into an insightful, provocative and entertaining five-screen video installation. So far, it has been exhibited in over 30 museums, festivals and institutions.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>So when did the website and mobile app come in?</strong><br/>
					Well, after the overwhelming success of the art installation, we wanted to expand the conversation and make it easier for Black males to participate across the country. So we created the site and app. And since questions and answers are added constantly, this creates a living archive of Black male voices that can be searched by location and timeframe – essentially generating a map of Black male identity. We want that map to be heavily populated in the next few years, so from September 2014 to summer 2016, the website and mobile app will be our main focus as we push for our participation goal of 200,000 Black males. We think that this will help us gain visibility as a place to find authentic Black male voices.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Where did the community engagement events come from?</strong><br/>
					In one of our recording sessions, a young man posed this question to elders: “Why didn’t you leave us the blueprint?” It inspired us to create our Blueprint Roundtables, events designed to create dialogue among Black males from different generations. During these sessions, the attendees identify practical roadmaps to success for Black men and boys. The program launched in 2012, and has spread to over 15 communities across the country.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>And you have an education curriculum, too?</strong><br/>
					Yes. Designed for high school students, the free Question Bridge curriculum focuses on themes of broad identity, conflict resolution, and inclusion. The curriculum is online, and teaching artists can be hired to conduct training sessions.

				<p>The
				QB Rules (which are part of these Terms) further detail what is
				prohibited on the Service. We also reserve the right to access, read,
				preserve, and disclose any information as we reasonably believe is
				necessary to (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal
				process or governmental request, (ii) enforce the Terms, including
				investigation of potential violations hereof, (iii) detect, prevent,
				or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, (iv)
				respond to user support requests, or (v) protect the rights, property
				or safety of QB, its users and the public. QB does not disclose
				personally identifying information to third parties except in
				accordance with our Privacy Policy.&nbsp;</p>
				<p>
				You may not do any of the
				following while accessing or using the Services: (i) access, tamper
				with, or use non-public areas of the Services, QB's computer systems,
				or the technical delivery systems of QB's providers; (ii) probe,
				scan, or test the vulnerability of any system or network or breach or
				circumvent any security or authentication measures; (iii) access or
				search or attempt to access or search the Services by any means
				(automated or otherwise) other than through our currently available,
				published interfaces that are provided by QB (and only pursuant to
				those terms and conditions), unless you have been specifically
				allowed to do so in a separate agreement with QB; (iv) forge any
				TCP/IP packet header or any part of the header information in any
				email or posting, or in any way use the Services to send altered,
				deceptive or false source-identifying information; or (v) interfere

				or network, including, without limitation, sending a virus,
				overloading, flooding, spamming, mail-bombing the Services, or by
				scripting the creation of Content in such a manner as to interfere
				with or create an undue burden on the Services.</p>
				<h3>9. Copyright Policy</h3>
				<p>
				QB respects the intellectual
				property rights of others and expects users of the Services to do the
				same. We will respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement
				that comply with applicable law and are properly provided to us. If
				you believe that your Content has been copied in a way that
				constitutes copyright infringement, please provide us with the
				following information: (i) a physical or electronic signature of the
				copyright owner or a person authorized to act on their behalf; (ii)
				identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been
				infringed; (iii) identification of the material that is claimed to be
				infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to
				be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information
				reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material; (iv) your
				contact information, including your address, telephone number, and an
				email address; (v) a statement by you that you have a good faith
				belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not
				authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and (vi) a
				statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and,
				under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of
				the copyright owner.</p>
				<p>
				We reserve the right to remove
				Content alleged to be infringing without prior notice and at our sole
				discretion. In appropriate circumstances, QB will also terminate a
				user's account if the user is determined to be a repeat infringer.
				Our designated copyright agent for notice of alleged copyright
				infringement appearing on the Services is:</p>
				<p><br>
				</p>
				<p><i>Copyright
				Agent - QB<br>address<br>E-mail: ________@questionbridge.com </i>
				</p>
				<h3>10. Ending These Terms</h3>
				<p>
				These Terms will continue to apply
				until terminated by either you or QB as follows:</p>
				<p>
				<br>
				</p>
				<p>You
				may end your legal agreement with QB at any time for any reason by
				deactivating accounts and discontinuing your use of the Services.
				However, you may not terminate any license granted to QB, and you may
				not challenge any copyright that QB owns, even in the absence of any
				copyright registration.</p>
				<p>
				We may suspend or terminate your
				accounts or cease providing you with all or part of the Services at
				any time for any reason, including, but not limited to, if we
				reasonably believe: (i) you have violated these Terms, (ii) you
				create risk or possible legal exposure for us; or (iii) our provision
				of the Services to you is no longer commercially viable. We will make
				reasonable efforts to notify you by the email address associated with
				your account or through the Services the next time you attempt to
				access your account.</p>
				<p>
				In all such cases, the Terms shall
				terminate, including, without limitation, your license to use the
				Services, except that the following sections shall continue to apply:
				4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, and 12.</p>
				<p>
				Nothing in this section shall
				affect QB's rights to change, limit or stop the provision of the
				Services without prior notice, as provided above in section 1.</p>
				<h3>11.Disclaimers and Limitations of
				Liability</h3>
				<p>
				<br>
				</p>
				<p>Please
				read this section carefully since it limits the liability of QB and
				its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, related companies, officers,
				directors, employees, agents, representatives, partners, and
				licensors (collectively, the "<b>QB
				Entities</b>").
				Each of the subsections below only applies up to the maximum extent
				permitted under applicable law. Some jurisdictions do not allow the
				disclaimer of implied warranties or the limitation of liability in
				contracts, and as a result the contents of this section may not apply
				to you. Nothing in this section is intended to limit any rights you
				may have which may not be lawfully limited.</p>
				<h4>A. The Services are Available
				"AS-IS"</h4>
				<p>
				Your access to and use of the
				Services or any Content is at your own risk. You understand and agree
				that the Services is provided to you on an "AS IS" and "AS
				AVAILABLE" basis. Without limiting the foregoing, QB ENTITIES
				DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
				OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR
				NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>
				<p>
				QB Entities make no warranty and
				disclaim all responsibility and liability for: (i) the completeness,
				accuracy, availability, timeliness, security or reliability of the
				Services or any Content; (ii) any harm to your computer system, loss
				of data, or other harm that results from your access to or use of the
				Services, or any Content; (iii) the deletion of, or the failure to
				store or to transmit, any Content and other communications maintained
				by the Services; (iv) whether the Services will meet your
				requirements or be available on an uninterrupted, secure, or
				error-free basis. No advice or information, whether oral or written,
				obtained from QB Entities or through the Services, will create any
				warranty not expressly made herein.</p>
				<h4>B. Links</h4>
				<p>
				The Services may contain links to
				third-party websites or resources. You acknowledge and agree that we
				are not responsible or liable for: (i) the availability or accuracy
				of such websites or resources; or (ii) the content, products, or
				services on or available from such websites or resources. Links to
				such websites or resources do not imply any endorsement by QB
				Entities of such websites or resources or the content, products, or
				services available from such websites or resources. You acknowledge
				sole responsibility for and assume all risk arising from your use of
				any such websites or resources.</p>
				<h4>
				C. Limitation of Liability</h4>
				<p>
				TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY
				APPLICABLE LAW, THE QB ENTITIES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT,
				INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS
				OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR
				ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOOD-WILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES,
				RESULTING FROM (i) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR
				USE THE SERVICES; (ii) ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON
				THE SERVICES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE
				OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OF OTHER USERS OR THIRD PARTIES; (iii) ANY CONTENT
				OBTAINED FROM THE SERVICES; OR (iv) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE OR
				ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR CONTENT.</p>
				<p>
				IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AGGREGATE
				LIABILITY OF THE QB ENTITIES EXCEED THE GREATER OF ONE HUNDRED U.S.
				DOLLARS (U.S. $100.00) OR THE AMOUNT YOU PAID QB, IF ANY, IN THE PAST
				SIX MONTHS FOR THE SERVICES GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.</p>
				<p>
				THE LIMITATIONS OF THIS SUBSECTION
				SHALL APPLY TO ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY,
				CONTRACT, STATUTE, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE, AND
				WHETHER OR NOT THE QB ENTITIES HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY
				OF ANY SUCH DAMAGE, AND EVEN IF A REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO
				HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.</p>
				<h3>
				12. General Terms</h3>
				<h4>
				A. Waiver and Severability</h4>
				<p>
				The failure of QB to enforce any
				right or provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of such
				right or provision. In the event that any provision of these Terms is
				held to be invalid or unenforceable, then that provision will be
				limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the
				remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and
				effect.</p>
				<h4>
				B. Controlling Law and
				Jurisdiction</h4>
				<p>
				These Terms and any action related
				thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of New York without
				regard to or application of its conflict of law provisions or your
				state or country of residence. All claims, legal proceedings or
				litigation arising in connection with the Services will be brought
				solely in the federal or state courts located in New York County, New
				York, United States, and you consent to the jurisdiction of and venue
				in such courts and waive any objection as to inconvenient forum.</p>
				<p>
				If you are a federal, state, or
				local government entity in the United States using the Services in
				your official capacity and legally unable to accept the controlling
				law, jurisdiction or venue clauses above, then those clauses do not
				apply to you. For such U.S. federal government entities, these Terms
				and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the
				United States of America (without reference to conflict of laws) and,
				in the absence of federal law and to the extent permitted under
				federal law, the laws of the State of New York (excluding choice of
				law).</p>
				<h4>
				C. Entire Agreement</h4>
				<p>These
				Terms, the QB Rules and our Privacy Policy are the entire and
				exclusive agreement between QB and you regarding the Services
				(excluding any services for which you have a separate written
				agreement with QB that is explicitly in addition or in place of these
				Terms), and these Terms supersede and replace any prior agreements
				between QB and you regarding the Services.</p>
				<p>
				We may revise these Terms from
				time to time, the most current version will always be at
				www.questionbridge.com. If the revision, in our sole discretion, is
				material we will notify you via email to the email associated with
				your account or through the Services. If you do not wish to be bound
				by any such revisions to the Terms, you must end these Terms with us
				as set forth in Section 10 above. By continuing to access or use the
				Services after those revisions become effective, you agree to be
				bound by the revised Terms.</p>

				<h2><u>QB
				Privacy Policy</u></h2>
				<p>This
				Privacy Policy describes how and when QB collects, uses, and shares
				your information when you use our Services. QB receives your
				information through our mobile applications, websites, email
				notifications, and other interactions with our Services. When using
				any of our Services you consent to the collection, transfer,
				manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information
				as described in this Privacy Policy. Irrespective of which country
				you reside in or supply information from, you authorize QB to use
				your information in the United States and any other country where QB
				operates.</p>

				  Information
				  Collection and Use</h3>
				</li></ol>
				<h3>
				</h3>
				<p>
				<b>Creating
				a QB Account and Profile Information:</b>&nbsp;When
				you create a QB account, you must provide access credentials either
				in the form of an email address and password or by authentication
				using another service, such as Twitter. You may optionally provide us
				with additional profile information, including a short bio, location,
				and profile picture. If you create your QB account by connecting
				through another service, we may use public information from that
				connected account to help complete your QB profile. You may update or
				modify your profile information and contact information at any time.
				Profile information is available publicly on our Services, such as on
				your profile page.</p>
				<p>
				<br>
				</p>
				<p><b>Contact
				Information:</b>&nbsp;In
				addition to using your contact information to create your account, we
				may use this information to send you information about our Services,
				respond to your requests and facilitate your use of the Services. We
				may use the contact information (such as your phone number or email
				address) to help connect you with other QB users, even if that
				information is not publicly displayed.</p>
				<p><br>
				</p>
				<p><b>Content,
				Following, and other Public Information:</b>&nbsp;QB
				is a video sharing platform, so most of the information you provide
				us is information that you choose to be made public. This includes
				not only the Content that you post and data provided with such
				Content, such as when it was posted, but also the accounts you
				follow, the Content that you like or comment on, and other public
				interactions on the Services. Your public information is broadly and
				instantly disseminated. For instance, your profile information and
				public Content are immediately delivered to a wide range of users and
				other services that access QB. When you share information or Content
				via the Services, you should think carefully about what you are
				making public.</p>
				<p><br>
				</p>
				<p><b>Location
				Information:</b>&nbsp;In
				addition to profile information, you may also tell us your exact
				location if you choose to enable your computer or mobile device to
				send us location information. We may use and store information about
				your location to provide features of our Services, such as tagging a
				video with a location, and to improve and customize the Services, for
				example, with Content that has been tagged near your location.</p>
				<p><br>
				</p>
				<p><b>Links:</b>&nbsp;We
				may keep track of how you interact with links across our Services,
				including our email notifications, third-party services, and client
				applications, by redirecting clicks or through other means. We do
				this to help improve our Services, for example to provide relevant
				advertising, and to be able to share aggregate click statistics such
				as how many times a particular link was clicked on.</p>
				<p><br>
				</p>
				<p><b>Cookies:</b>&nbsp;Like
				many websites, we use "cookie" technology to collect
				additional website usage data and to improve our Services, but we do
				not require cookies for many parts of our Services such as viewing
				public videos. A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to
				your computer's hard disk. QB may use both session cookies and
				persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our
				Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic
				routing on our Services, and to customize and improve our Services.
				Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. If you do not
				want cookies from QB or other websites, you can instruct your
				browser, by changing its settings, to stop accepting cookies or to
				prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit.
				However, some Services may not function properly if you disable
				cookies.</p>
				<p><br>
				</p>
				<p><b>Log
				Data:</b>&nbsp;Our
				servers automatically record information ("<strong>Log
				Data</strong>")
				created by your use of the Services. Log Data may include information
				such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, the
				referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier,
				device and application IDs, search terms, and cookie information. We
				receive Log Data when you interact with our Services, for example,
				when you visit our websites, sign into our Services, view videos
				hosted by QB, or interact with our email notifications. QB uses Log
				Data to provide our Services and to measure, customize, and improve
				them. If not already done earlier, we will either delete Log Data or
				remove any common account identifiers, such as your username, full IP
				address, or email address, after 18 months.</p>
				<p><br>
				</p>
				<p><b>Third-Party
				Service Providers: </b>QB
				uses a variety of third-party services to help provide our Services
				(for example, and without limitation, hosting various blogs and
				wikis), and to help us understand the use of our Services, such as
				Google Analytics. These third-party service providers may collect
				information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, such
				as cookies or your IP address.</p>

				<p><b>Service
				Providers:</b>&nbsp;We
				engage service providers to perform functions and provide services to

				on the condition that the third parties use your private personal
				data only on our behalf and pursuant to our instructions.</p>
				<p><br>
				</p>
				<p><b>Law
				and Harm:</b>&nbsp;Notwithstanding
				anything to the contrary in this Policy, we may preserve or disclose
				your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to
				comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety
				of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues; or to
				protect QB’s rights or property. However, nothing in this Privacy
				Policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you
				may have to a third party's, including a government's, request to
				disclose your information.</p>
				<p><br>
				</p>
				<p><b>Business
				Transfers:</b>&nbsp;In
				the event that QB is involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition,
				reorganization or sale of assets, your information may be sold or
				transferred as part of that transaction. The promises in this Privacy
				Policy will apply to your information as transferred to the new
				entity.</p>

				</p>
				<p><b>Non-Private
				or Non-Personal Information:</b>&nbsp;We
				may share or disclose your non-private, aggregated or otherwise
				non-personal information, such as your public user profile

				or the number of users who clicked on a particular link (even if only
